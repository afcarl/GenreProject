manualcoding
------------

Subdirectory for manual coding of snippets.

The main file here is **manualcoding.py**. It should be placed in the same directory with

**twentyfivesnippets.tsv** -- The source file of snippets.

**unifiedficmetadata.csv** -- The metadata for this collection.

The file **conversions.py** translates coded snippets into a csv file, which can then be visualized by **barplot.R**.
