# manualcoding.py

# Tagging snippets by hand, so we can generalize a little about references
# to money in fiction.

 # The data structure for the coded snippets is as follows:
    # 0) date,
    # 1) volumeid
    # 2) reference type: a (q)uantity of money "five dollars",
        # or an (e)rror -- not money or not quantifiable

    # 3) unit of currency in which money is denominated

    # 4) value -- nominal value of money.

    # 5) socialcontext â€” gift, bribe, inheritance, rent, interest,
        # capital, wages, price, etc. This list can be expanded at will
        # by coders; this script allows you to add to it.

    # 6) snippet.
