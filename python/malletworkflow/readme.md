malletworkflow
--------------

This repo holds scripts I use to translate mallet state files into usable matrixes and visualizations. It's also just a holding area for reminders
and notes about the process.

Several of the Python scripts were originally written by Andrew Goldstone, notable simplify_state.py, make_doc_topics.py, and make_word_year.py.

The workflow is more fully described in recipe.txt.
